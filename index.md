My name is Zhanhong Cheng (Á®ãÂ±ïÈ∏ø). I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Civil Engineering at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/).
My research focuses on developing data-driven and knowledge-driven solutions for intelligent, sustainable, and accessible transportation. Drawing on techniques such as machine learning, statistical modeling, optimization, and transportation network analysis, I develop applications and discover knowledge from massive multi-modal transportation data.
